# Just Kiddin'
Just Kiddin' is a joking app builded vanilla JS, designed to get jokes from [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and [Chuck Norris](https://api.chucknorris.io/) API randomly. It also fetchs with [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather of the location where the browser is located.
> *Nothing is a better icebreaker than a great joke.*
